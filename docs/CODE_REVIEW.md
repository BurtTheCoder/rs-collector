# Rust Collector Code Review

## Issues Addressed

1. **Removed Redundant Collector Modules**
   - Removed individual collector files (mft.rs, registry.rs, eventlogs.rs) which were replaced by the configuration-based approach
   - These modules were no longer needed after implementing the unified YAML-based artifact collection system

2. **Cleaned Up Unused Code**
   - Removed unused `get_artifact_type()` method from the ArtifactCollector trait
   - Removed unused `get_artifacts_by_type()` method from CollectionConfig
   - Commented out unused `filetime_to_iso8601()` function but kept as reference for Windows implementation
   - Commented out unused BUFFER_SIZE constant

3. **Improved Environment Variable Processing**
   - Fixed implementation of environment variable expansion in paths
   - Eliminated possible borrowing issues in the string replacement logic
   - Made the variable expansion more robust with proper error handling

## Current Architecture

1. **Configuration Module** (`config/mod.rs`)
   - Handles YAML configuration parsing
   - Defines artifact types and artifact definitions
   - Manages both runtime and embedded configurations
   - Handles environment variable expansion in paths

2. **Collector Module** (`collectors/collector.rs`)
   - Provides a unified interface for collecting all artifact types
   - Organizes artifacts by type in the output directory
   - Tracks collection success/failure with proper error handling

3. **Windows Module** (`windows/`)
   - Contains mock implementations for macOS development
   - Includes raw_access.rs for file collection methods
   - Includes privileges.rs for enabling backup privileges
   - All Windows-specific functionality is isolated here

4. **Build System** (`build.rs`)
   - Generates build scripts for creating standalone binaries
   - Manages embedding configuration at compile time
   - Simplifies deployment for environments with limited file access

## Future Windows Implementation Notes

For a proper Windows implementation:

1. **Raw File Access**
   - Implement proper raw file access using `CreateFileW` with backup semantics
   - Use the commented buffer size for file read/write operations

2. **Windows Privileges**
   - Properly enable backup/restore privileges using Windows security APIs
   - Add error handling for privilege elevation failures

3. **File Time Conversion**
   - Implement the commented `filetime_to_iso8601` function using Windows FILETIME structs

## Conclusion

The codebase is now clean, well-structured, and ready for either:
- Further development on Windows systems
- Deployment as a macOS prototype with mock implementations

All identified issues have been addressed, and the code structure follows a modular, maintainable design that will make future enhancements easier to implement.
