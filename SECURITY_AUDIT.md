# Security Audit Report for rs-collector

## Executive Summary

This security audit identifies potential vulnerabilities in the rs-collector codebase and provides recommendations for remediation. The audit covers common security concerns including input validation, error handling, memory safety, and privilege management.

## Findings

### 1. Excessive Use of `unwrap()` and `expect()` (HIGH SEVERITY)

**Issue**: Found 408 instances of `unwrap()` and 12 instances of `expect()` throughout the codebase.

**Risk**: These can cause panic and program crashes when encountering unexpected conditions, potentially leading to denial of service.

**Affected Files**:
- Multiple files across all modules
- Particularly prevalent in test code and error paths

**Recommendation**: 
- Replace `unwrap()` with proper error handling using `?` operator or `match` statements
- Use `expect()` only in cases where failure is truly unrecoverable
- Add context to errors using `.context()` from anyhow

### 2. Unsafe Code Usage (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

**Issue**: Found 41 instances of `unsafe` blocks, primarily in:
- Windows privilege escalation code
- macOS memory access routines
- Platform-specific system calls

**Risk**: Potential for memory corruption, undefined behavior, or security vulnerabilities if not handled correctly.

**Affected Files**:
- `/src/privileges/windows.rs`
- `/src/privileges/macos.rs`
- `/src/windows/raw_access/*.rs`
- `/src/collectors/memory/platforms/macos.rs`

**Recommendation**:
- Document safety invariants for each unsafe block
- Consider using safe wrappers where possible
- Add additional validation before unsafe operations

### 3. Command Injection Risks (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

**Issue**: Several instances of `Command::new()` with dynamic arguments.

**Risk**: If user input is passed to these commands without validation, it could lead to command injection.

**Affected Files**:
- `/src/collectors/platforms/linux.rs` (journalctl)
- `/src/collectors/platforms/macos.rs` (log, plutil, file)
- `/src/privileges/linux.rs` (capsh)

**Recommendation**:
- Never pass user input directly to shell commands
- Use argument arrays instead of shell strings
- Validate and sanitize all inputs before use

### 4. Path Traversal Vulnerabilities (LOW-MEDIUM SEVERITY)

**Issue**: File paths are constructed from user input without sufficient validation.

**Risk**: Attackers could potentially access files outside intended directories.

**Affected Areas**:
- Artifact collection paths
- Output directory creation
- Configuration file paths

**Recommendation**:
- Canonicalize all paths before use
- Validate paths don't contain `..` sequences
- Ensure paths remain within expected boundaries

### 5. Privilege Escalation Concerns (HIGH SEVERITY)

**Issue**: The application requests and uses elevated privileges on all platforms.

**Risk**: If compromised, the application could be used to access sensitive system resources.

**Affected Files**:
- `/src/privileges/*.rs`
- Windows: Requests multiple privileges including SeDebugPrivilege
- macOS/Linux: Checks for root access

**Recommendation**:
- Run with minimum required privileges
- Drop privileges after initial setup when possible
- Clearly document why each privilege is needed
- Add warnings to users about privilege requirements

### 6. Sensitive Data Handling (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

**Issue**: The application collects potentially sensitive forensic data including:
- Memory dumps
- Registry keys
- System logs
- User data

**Risk**: Sensitive information could be exposed if output files are not properly protected.

**Recommendation**:
- Encrypt output files by default
- Set restrictive file permissions on output
- Add option to redact sensitive information
- Warn users about sensitive data collection

### 7. Input Validation (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

**Issue**: Limited validation of configuration files and command-line arguments.

**Risk**: Malformed input could cause crashes or unexpected behavior.

**Affected Areas**:
- YAML configuration parsing
- Command-line argument parsing
- File path validation

**Recommendation**:
- Add comprehensive input validation
- Set reasonable limits on string lengths
- Validate all file paths and URLs
- Use strong typing where possible

### 8. Dependency Security (LOW SEVERITY)

**Issue**: The project uses multiple external dependencies which may have vulnerabilities.

**Dependencies of Concern**:
- SSH2 library for SFTP operations
- AWS SDK for S3 uploads
- Various system interaction crates

**Recommendation**:
- Regular dependency audits using `cargo audit`
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review security advisories for critical dependencies
- Consider using `cargo-deny` for policy enforcement

## Recommended Security Improvements

### Immediate Actions

1. **Fix Critical unwrap() Usage**
   - Priority: Fix unwrap() calls in main execution paths
   - Focus on file I/O and network operations
   - Add proper error context

2. **Validate All Inputs**
   - Add path traversal protection
   - Validate configuration files
   - Sanitize command arguments

3. **Document Security Model**
   - Create security documentation
   - Document privilege requirements
   - Add security warnings to README

### Short-term Improvements

1. **Implement Secure Defaults**
   - Encrypt output by default
   - Use restrictive file permissions
   - Disable dangerous features by default

2. **Add Security Tests**
   - Test path traversal prevention
   - Test privilege dropping
   - Fuzz test input parsing

3. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Replace remaining unwrap() calls
   - Add comprehensive error context
   - Implement proper error recovery

### Long-term Enhancements

1. **Security Hardening**
   - Implement sandboxing where possible
   - Add code signing for releases
   - Consider security audit by third party

2. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Add security event logging
   - Implement audit trails
   - Monitor for suspicious behavior

3. **Secure Development Practices**
   - Add security checks to CI/CD
   - Implement dependency scanning
   - Regular security reviews

## Conclusion

The rs-collector project has several security concerns that should be addressed, particularly around error handling, privilege management, and input validation. While many of these issues are common in system-level forensic tools, implementing the recommended improvements will significantly enhance the security posture of the application.

Priority should be given to fixing the excessive use of unwrap(), implementing proper input validation, and documenting the security model clearly for users.
